                <h3>Chapter 8: Transforms and Transitions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transform: The CSS3 transform property allow you to translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.</li>
                    <li>You can move elements left, right, up, or down. Similary to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and left, moving elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axes.</li>
                    <li>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values</li>
                    <li>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.</li>
                    <li>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you'd expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y axis. </li>
                    <li>The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state. You can specify this either in seconds ( s ) or milliseconds ( ms ).</li>
                    <li>The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail.</li>
                    <li>By using the transition-delay property, it's possible to introduce a delay before the transition begins. Normally a transition begins immediately, so the default is 0 . Include the number of milliseconds ( ms ) or seconds ( s ) to
                        delay the transition.</li>
                    <li>Animation-name: This property is used to attach an animation (previously defined using the @keyframes syntax) to an element.</li>
                    <li>Animation-duration: The animation-duration property defines the length of time (in seconds or milliseconds) an animation takes to complete one iteration (all the way through, from 0% to 100%)</li>
                    <li>Animation-timing-function: the animation-timing-function determines how the animation will progress over its duration.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h3>Chapter 12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>With HTML5's Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>The text in between the canvas tags will only be shown if the canvas element is not supported by the visitor's browser.</li>
                    <li>Once a canvas element is stored in a js variable, we MUST setup the context. The context is the place where your drawing is rendered.</li>
                    <li>Using fillReact and strokeReact methods, we are able to draw a rectangle on the canvas.</li>
                    <li>To draw a circle, we use the beginPath(), arc(), and closePath methods.</li>
                    <li>To save a Canvas drawing, meaning to store it locally, we can use the toDataUrl method. This method creates a URL with the image in it.</li>
                    <li>SVG stands for a scalable vector graphic. Instead of pixels, each "pixel" works as a vector using vector math. It scales and doesn't go blurry.</li>
                </ul>
