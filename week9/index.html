                <h3>Chapter 9: The Window Object</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Window Object: In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which represents the browser window that contains a web page.</li>
                    <li>Window Object: In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which represents the browser window that contains a web page.</li>
                    <li>To access the BOM, we use the window object to access the properties and methods</li>
                    <li>Global variables are properties of the global object. They are created without the use of const, let, or var.</li>
                    <li>The window object has some dialog methods: window.alert(), window.confirm(), window.prompt()</li>
                    <li>Document object: the window object contains a document object. This object has properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window.</li>
                    <li>Document.write(): Writes a string of text to the page. It will replace whatever html was there.</li>
                    <li>Cookies: Cookies are used to store data about the user for the site. Cookies take the form of a text file that contain a list of name/value pairs separated by semicolons.</li>

                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Chapter 14: HTML5 APIs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML5 Web Storage: The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client's computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. This makes it perfect for
                        storing information about users, as well as storing application-specific information that can then be used during future sessions.</li>
                    <li>If Web storage is not supported by the browser then the window object has the "localStorage" property</li>
                    <li>There is also sessionStorage, which works the same as a php session</li>
                    <li>Every time a value is saved to localStorage, a storage event is fired.</li>
                    <li>We can use JSON.stringify() to store any JS object in local storage</li>
                    <li>To use this API, we use the navigator object in combination with the getCurrentPosition() method</li>
                    <li>For example: "navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(youAreHere);"</li>
                    <li>youAreHere is a position object with a coords property with a latitude and longitude</li>

                </ul>
