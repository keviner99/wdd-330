                <li>How can I give users a list of stories names they've already stored?</li>
                <p>
                    I have already remembered my story name because I wrote it down on paper, but what about people who write lots of stories. That's why I want to create a list of all story names created previously. The list should appear on the screen.

                This week I spent time reading on the book "Doing Stuff with Web Thing" by Lee S. Barney. I review some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts that I took in previous courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using JavaScript you can store any information you want to use later. Even if your user refreshes the page or goes to some other site and then comes back. We called LocalStorage to code that stores the story.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript's local storage uses what techies call key-value pairs. An old fashioned phone book is the best example to understand this principle. The key would be the person's name and the value would be their address and phone number.
