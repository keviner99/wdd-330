                <ul>
                    <li>The recommended way of using STRICT MODE is to place it inside an IIFE, because other people may not be using STRICT MODE. This ensures that only our code is in strict mode.</li>
                    <li>JS functions can also define and rewrite themselves by calling themselves inside the function. Note that previously set properties of a function will be lost if this is done.</li>
                    <li>A PROMISE represents the future result of an asynchronous operation.</li>
                    <li> promise is created using a constructor function. This takes a function called an EXECUTOR as an argument. The executor initializes the promise and starts the asynchronous operation.</li>
                    <li>HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS are functions that accept another function as an argument, or return another function as a result, or both.</li>


                </ul>

                <h3>Chapter 13: AJAX</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading.</li>
                    <li>Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of the client. The resources requested are usually JSON data or small fragments of text or HTML rather than a whole web page.</li>
                    <li>The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch.</li>
                    <li>JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX responses. The json() method is used to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object.</li>
                    <li>Request objects are created using the Request() constructor, and include the following properties: url, method, headers, mode, cache, credentials, redirect</li>
                    <li>FETCH API has a Headers Interface. HTTP headers are used to pass on any additional information about a request or response. Typical information contained in headers includes the file-type of the resource, cookie information, authentication
                        information and when the resource was last modified.The Fetch API introduced a Headers interface, which can be used to create a Headers object, which can then be added as a property of Request and Response objects.</li>
                </ul>
