                <h3>Chapter8: Forms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Forms are a very common method of interacting with a web page. </li>
                    <li>The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically.</li>
                    <li>The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML.</li>
                    <li>Reset buttons are generally considered poop for usability, as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data.</li>
                    <li>Password is used to convert a word, number, or characters into character * thus hiding the typed information.</li>
                    <li>Number will force the keyboard to only accept numbers except for the letter e or E for exponential.</li>
                    <li>Another useful technique that can aid usability is to disable the submit button if there are erros on the form.</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Chapter 12: Object-oriented Programming(OOP) in JavaScript</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Encapsulation let The end-user can only see the essential functionalities such as the fields and buttons, but the programming logic is all written inside an object.</li>
                    <li>Polymorphism allows programmers to use the same process or method for different objects. This method also allows the object to override share methods.</li>
                    <li>Inheritance allows an object to use another object's features by inheriting all its properties and methods and adding some new features if possible.</li>
                    <li>Many object-oriented languages, such as Java and Ruby, are known as class-based languages. This is because they use a class to define a blueprint for an object.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Chapter 15: Modern JavaScript Development</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It can be helpful to use a library, but you should certainlu question whether it's worth the extra work.</li>
                    <li>You can use npm to uninstall a pacjage using the uninstall command.</li>
                    <li>MVC Frameworks: Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a programming design used by server-side frameworks such as Ruby On Rails and Django. Recently, it has been used in JavaScript to organize large-scale web applications.</li>
                    <li>Models: Models are ways for implementing the CRUD operations (creating, reading, updating, and deleting). For example, dynamic navigation will request that all views (pages) access the database items from a single controller so that
                        when the database is manipulated, the navigation bar reads the data accordingly.</li>
                    <li>Views: Throughout the browser, views provide a visual representation of the model showing all the relevant information and also provide a way for users to interact with an application, usually via forms.</li>
                    <li>Controllers: are create links between models and views together by communicating between them. They respond to events, which are usually inputs from a user (entering some data into a form, for example), process the information, then
                        update the model and view accordingly.</li>
