                    <li>Buttons trigger events in our web pages. Carefully selecting the correct use of them such as the reset button that is not advisable since they can wipe out all the data that was entered.</li>
                    <li>Password is used to convert a word, number, or characters into character * thus hiding the typed information.</li>
                    <li>Number will force the keyboard to only accept numbers except for the letter e or E for exponential.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Encapsulation let The end-user can only see the essential functionalities such as the fields and buttons, but the programming logic is all written inside an object.</li>
                    <li>Polymorphism allows programmers to use the same process or method for different objects. This method also allows the object to override share methods.</li>
                    <li>Inheritance allows an object to use another object's features by inheriting all its properties and methods and adding some new features if possible.</li>

                <h3>Chapter 15: Modern JavaScript Development</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>MVC Frameworks: Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a programming design used by server-side frameworks such as Ruby On Rails and Django. Recently, it has been used in JavaScript to organize large-scale web applications.</li>
                    <li>Models: Models are ways for implementing the CRUD operations (creating, reading, updating, and deleting). For example, dynamic navigation will request that all views (pages) access the database items from a single controller so that
                        when the database is manipulated, the navigation bar reads the data accordingly.</li>
                    <li>Views: Throughout the browser, views provide a visual representation of the model showing all the relevant information and also provide a way for users to interact with an application, usually via forms.</li>
                    <li>Controllers: are create links between models and views together by communicating between them. They respond to events, which are usually inputs from a user (entering some data into a form, for example), process the information, then
                        update the model and view accordingly.</li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li></li>
