                <h3>MDN: Validating forms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away. If it gets to the server and is then rejected, a noticeable
                        delay is caused by a round trip to the server and then back to the client-side to tell the user to fix their data.</li>
                    <li>However, client-side validation should not be considered an exhaustive security measure! Your apps should always perform security checks on any form-submitted data on the server-side as well as the client-side, because client-side
                        validation is too easy to bypass, so malicious users can still easily send bad data through to your server.</li>
                    <li>Three reasons for client-side validation: Right data in the right format, protect user data, and protect ourselves.</li>
                    <li>Two types of client-side validation: Built-in HTML5 form validation or JavaScript Libraries</li>
                    <li>Examples of built-in validation elements: required, minlength, maxlength, min, max, type, :valid, and so forth</li>
                    <li>JavaScript form validation should be used when one wants to control the look and feel of the native error messages.</li>
                    <li>Constraint Validation API: provides a set of methods and properties that help to customize error messages and form validation</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>MDN: Using Fetch</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fetch Api: The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch
                        resources asynchronously across the network.</li>
                    <li>The fetch() method can optionally accept a second parameter, an init object that allows you to control a number of different settings</li>
                    <li>Basically the Fetch API makes client-side stuff sent to the server easier.</li>
                </ul>
